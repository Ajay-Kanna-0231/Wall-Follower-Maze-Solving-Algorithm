# Wall-Follower-Maze-Solving-Algorithm

## Overview

This C++ project implements a maze-solving algorithm based on the wall follower approach. The algorithm navigates through a maze by following the walls until it reaches the destination point. This README provides an overview of the project, how to use it, and key details about the code

## Features

- A maze-solving algorithm using the wall follower approach.
- Code written in C++.
- Designed to work with Tinkercad
